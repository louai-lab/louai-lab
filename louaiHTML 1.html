            Codi is a Beirut based training center offering an intensive 6-month programme for students to become junior web and mobile developers, proficient in English, and obtain the necessary life skills to be successful in any profession.
            Codi is a combination between a coding bootcamp and a leadership programme based in Beirut whose aim is to get underprivileged youth to participate in the growing needs of the local ICT sector.
            
            Codi is a free school of web and mobile programming for young individuals (17 years old and over) who have a passion for digital and want to build a career in technology but lack the financial means to pursue a traditional education.
             It is the first training centre to foster digital and technical skills for this youth in Lebanon.
